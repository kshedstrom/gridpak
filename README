grid_Arctic_2:
#xpots -N 2017 -F fort.41
xpots -N 2177 -F fort.43

With hmin = 10 on ETOPO1 bathymetry:
300 passes of bathsuds, 1 of bathsoap.


grid_Arctic_3: same grid as above, more land masking and this bathymetry:

With hmin = 2 and combo bathymetry:
hraw = 1 SRTM30
hraw = 2 SRTM30 clipped to 2 m
hraw = 3 IBCAO3
hraw = 4 IBCAO3 clipped to 2 m
hraw = 5 AOOS
hraw = 6 AOOS clipped to 2 m
hraw = 7 best of the lot of them, clipped to 2 m
hraw = 8,9: 30 bathsuds, 1 bathsoap

grid_Arctic_4: same grid as above, bathymetry from Arctic3, Hudson bay opened up again,
get rid of 1-grid bays/passages where there could be ice. Probably need some
dredging...

With hmin = 2 and combo bathymetry:
hraw = 7 best of the lot of them, clipped to 2 m
hraw = 8,9: 24 bathsuds, 1 bathsoap

grid_Arctic_5: same land mask as Arctic4, edited around Cook Inlet,
PWS. Keeping the old bathymetries, but adding IBCAO4 (remapped to lon,lat
by John Pender).
hraw = 10 IBCAO4
hraw = 11 IBCAO4 clipped to 2 m
hraw = 12 best of the lot of them, clipped to 2 m

hraw = 13 deepening upper Cook Inlet to match hraw = 9.

Since this grid will be used with MOM6, it is unclear how much (if any)
smoothing is appropriate.
