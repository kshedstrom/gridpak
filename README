This is grid generation software used for building ROMS grids the
old-fashioned way. The manual (which needs updating) is here:
    https://marine.rutgers.edu/po/tools/gridpak/grid_manual.ps.gz

You must have consistent versions of a Fortran compiler and the NetCDF library.
I used to use NCL for plots and you can still enable the plotting if you want.

I'm distributing it with several test cases, each with their own Include
directory. Point to the appropriate Include directory in the Makefile. The
grid input file(s) are in the current directory. The domains here:

* Benguela: a rotated rectangular grid
  Notes on Benguela bathymetry:
       hmin=50, 300 bathsuds, 1 bathsoap => 0.33 rmax
* Bering Strait: a non-rotated rectangle
* Island: a small very curvilinear toy domain between Iceland and Greenland
* S_Africa: a U-shaped domain around southern Africa using xpots on side 2:
    xpots -N 1601 -F fort.42
* Supercritical: an idealized test problem in x,y space with a flat bottom
* Arctic_6: Pan-Arctic grid being run with MOM6

Issues:

* There's something wrong with the Makefile dependencies and I don't know
  why - trying to do everything the ROMS way (and the ROMS way works). Best
  to do "make clean" between builds if anything at all goes wrong.

* I'd put xpots out on github if it was working... The graphics now show
  up for me all in black, so it's quite tricky to use.

* I'm using Tolat2 to do the inverse map projection. There's got to be a better way.

=Arctic notes
With hmin = 2 and combo bathymetry:
hraw = 1 GEBCO_2020
hraw = 2 GEBCO_2020 clipped to 2 m
