Warning! This thing does not depend on the NCARG library any more, but
the order of operations is not at all obvious. Do up through bathtub,
and optaining the merged bathymetry. Then the Sasha operations, then
sphere, then editmask, then the bathy smoothing, then sphere again.

For Chukchi 3 hraw:

1, 2: Ibcao 3 and Ibcao 3 clipped.
3, 4: ARDEM 2 and ARDEM 2 clipped.
5: combo of 2 and 4.
6: 11 passes of bathsuds.
7: 1 pass of bathsoap

For Chukchi 4 hraw:

1, 2: ARDEM 2 and ARDEM 2 clipped.
3, 4: Ibcao 3 and Ibcao 3 clipped.
5: combo of 2 and 4.
6: 9 passes of bathsuds.
7: 1 pass of bathsoap

For Chukchi 5 hraw:

1, 2: ARDEM 2 and ARDEM 2 clipped.
3, 4: Ibcao 3 and Ibcao 3 clipped.
5: combo of 2 and 4.
6: 5 passes of bathsuds.
7: 1 pass of bathsoap

I ran Sasha's

        gshhs_to_roms_mask grid_Chukchi_5.nc
	copymask mask.nc grid_Chukchi_5.nc
	single_connect_cb 200 200 grid_Chukchi_5.nc

Note that single_connect keeps one-grid bays while single_connect_cb
closes the one-grid bays (compile-time switch). Sasha's tools only
update the mask_rho. Ideally, ROMS would just read that and compute
consistent mask_u, mask_v but that's not how it goes today, though ROMS
does compute mask_psi.

Note 2 on single_connect: It was hanging for me, not even giving
consistent output, but consistently not finishing. I started up inside
totalview and it ran like a charm in no time at all:

   mpirun -tv -np 1 ~/bin/single_connect_cb 200 200 grid_Chukchi_5.nc

In fact, this works great without the -tv switch.

Note 3: Turn a bay into a lake and single_connect will do the rest of
the filling in. A shortcut!
